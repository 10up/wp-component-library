<p>
	At 10up, we strive to provide websites that yield a top-notch user
	experience. In order to improve both our efficiency and consistency, we
	need to standardize what we use and how we use it. Standardizing our
	approach to commonly-used front-end components allows us to understand
	better the inner workings of a client's project and produce better
	solutions.
</p>

<p>
	While creating this library we took special care to ensure that each
	component meets the baseline accessibility standards of WCAG 2.1. This helps
	 us build each component up from a strong base to create a positive
	 end-to-end experience for all users.
