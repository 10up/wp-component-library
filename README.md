## Overview

At 10up, we strive to provide websites that yield a top-notch user experience. In order to improve both our efficiency and consistency, we need to standardize what we use and how we use it. Standardizing our approach to commonly-used front-end components allows us to understand better the inner workings of someone else’s project and produce better solutions for ourselves and our clients.

Each component in this library is built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, tailored to fit the often opinionated nature of WordPress core output. These components are intended to be easily adapted to any number of different projects and use cases.

All components are tested to be WCAG 2.1 Compliant.
