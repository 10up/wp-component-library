### Audience

The 10up Front-end Component Library is not geared to teach anyone to become an engineer. Rather, it intends to provide a base set of commonly-used front-end components, built with accessibility and WordPress in mind, for engineers to take and build upon. It also aims illustrate how to engineer the 10up way. As such, the components in this library are intended for capable engineers.

<h3 id="goal">Goal {% include partials/top %}</h3>

As a company, we strive to provide websites that yield a top-notch user experience. In order to improve efficiency, we need to standardize what we use and how we use it. Standardizing our approach to common components will allow us to build with greater speed and consistency, better understand the inner workings of someone elseâ€™s project, and produce better solutions ourselves and our clients.

<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy {% include partials/top %}</h3>

> "We make web publishing easy. Maybe even fun."

At the very heart of 10up is the publishing or user experience. WordPress, we firmly believe, is the best starting point to achieve this. We design and build custom publishing experiences for major companies and brands around the world. Our publishing experiences or websites are tailor-made for our clients and their specific needs.

As such, the content management experience cannot be made to be generic. We don't cut corners when it comes to user experience and interface. We don't take shortcuts that compromise the end experience for the user. We don't distribute pre-packaged, auto-generated user interfaces or components.

> "Keep it simple."

While our solutions are complex, we want our code, tools, processes, systems, and practices to be as simple as possible. Simplicity facilitates collaboration as there is a lower barrier of entry. This goes for things like PHP design patterns as well as workflow. We discourage practices such as writing extra levels of code abstraction (wrapping existing API's) as they complicate debugging and add another component that needs to be maintained.

> "We are always learning."

We are constantly challenging ourselves and learning. Knowledge gives us a competitive edge. Everyone around us is growing; if we stop growing individually or collectively and stop challenging ourselves to improve, we fall behind. For that reason, this document is not set in stone and will change. Evolving these components through contributions is incredibly important to us.
