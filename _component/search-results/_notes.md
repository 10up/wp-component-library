Notes
==========

The SearchPage component contains very generic schema markup. depending on which type of content is being displayed within your results, you may have to consult [schema.org](http://schema.org) for more specific attributes (books, audiobooks, blogposts, etc.). This example uses "[Thing](http://schema.org/Thing)" because we wanted to keep it generic.. When modifying this component you should feel free to use any HTML that fits the structure and hierarchy of your project, while maintaining any of the schema-related HTML attributes (`itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop`, etc.).
