The Blogroll component is using the "[BlogPosting](https://schema.org/BlogPosting)" schema. When modifying this component, you should feel free to use any HTML that fits the structure and hierarchy of your project, while maintaining any of the schema-related HTML attributes (`itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop`, etc.).
