The Person component is set up for you to harvest schema markup as you see fit to make HTML surrounding people or a person more machine readable. When modifying this component you should feel free to use any HTML that fits the structure and hierarchy of your project, while maintaining any of the schema-related HTML attributes (`itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop`, etc.).
