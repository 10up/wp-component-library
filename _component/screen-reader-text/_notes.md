The use of a .screen-reader-text class has various uses that help improve accessibility. We use this class as an alternative to hiding content with display:none that we still want to be accessible via screen reader.

One such use for this class could be in "read more" links.

Ideally your link text should be descriptive enough to stand alone. Links like "click here", "learn more", "continue reading", and "read more" are only helpful within the context of the content. However when screen readers extract all links from a page for easy navigation, you end up with a lot of links that don't say anything about where they go. Very unhelpful, right?

That's where this class comes in.

We also use this class on icon fonts and buttons where a screen reader could use that extra context. Take a look at a few of our examples below.
