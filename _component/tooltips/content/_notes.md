The Tooltip component can be used in three forms:

1. A standard hover tooltip over a link/button/text input;
2. A hover tooltip over a non-focusable element (like a `<span>`, the JavaScript will make it accessible);
3. A togglable tooltip (click to hide/show).

There are also delay and timing options available, however the default timing of 1 second mimics the title attribute timing (which was the previous WCAG standard; timing requirements have since been removed).
