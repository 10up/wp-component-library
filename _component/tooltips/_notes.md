The tooltip component is a standard and accessible JavaScript plugin that was converted from a jQuery plugin by Scott Ohara, you can [view the jQuery plugin on Github](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible-components). No jQuery is required for [this version](https://github.com/timwright12/a11y-tooltips).

It can be used in three forms:

1. a standard hover tooltip over a link/button/text input;
2. a hover tooltip over a non-focusable element (like a `<span>`, the JavaScript will make it accessible);
3. a togglable tooltip (click to hide/show).

There are also delay and timing options available, however the default timing of 1 second mimics the title attribute timing (which was the previous WCAG standard; timing requirements have since been removed).

The converted plugin weâ€™re using is also hosted on Github, you can [download the plugin](https://github.com/timwright12/a11y-tooltips) itself.
