The Tooltip component is a vetted accessible plugin that can be used in three forms:

1. a standard hover tooltip over a link/button/text input;
2. a hover tooltip over a non-focusable element (like a `<span>`, the JavaScript will make it accessible);
3. a togglable tooltip (click to hide/show).

There are also delay and timing options available, however the default timing of 1 second mimics the title attribute timing.
