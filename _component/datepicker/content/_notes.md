The datepicker component is based off the popular plugin [Pikaday](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday), it was chosen because it passed accessibility, performance, and quality tests. Therefore the [pikaday.js](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday/blob/master/pikaday.js) file and [pikaday.css](https://github.com/Pikaday/Pikaday/blob/master/css/pikaday.css) file is necessary to use this component out of the box before customizing for your own use. Pikaday is also generally flexible enough with a strong API to accomplish most goals of any datepicker you might encounter.
