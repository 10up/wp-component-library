The author bio component is a dual-purpose component in that it provides a common layout for authoring information within a blog post or article and it also gives us a specialized schema markup pattern so the content is more machine-readable. When modifying this component you should feel free to use any HTML that fits the structure and hierarchy of your project, while maintaining any of the schema-related HTML attributes (`itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop`, etc.).
