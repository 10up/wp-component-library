The custom select menu is some help HTML & CSS for when you need a non-default select menu styled for a design. This does not include the open menu state. If that needs styling you will have to evaluate a plugin like [Selectize](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) or [Chosen](https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/). Both are fine options.

To use this component you will also need to [download the arrow SVG graphic](icon-arrow-down.svg) that is referenced in the SCSS file.
