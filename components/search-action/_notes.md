Notes
==========

The search action component is a schema marked up search box. This will produce a site-specific [search box](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/enhance-site) within google search results. If you want to opt out of the sitelinks search box, add this to the <head> : <meta name="google" content="nositelinkssearchbox" />. Don't forget that the label's "for" should always match the input's "id" ("q", in this case). When modifying this component you should feel free to use any HTML that fits the structure and hierarchy of your project, while maintaining any of the schema-related HTML attributes (`itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop`, etc.).
