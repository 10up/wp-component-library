Notes
==========

The BlogPosting component is meant to serve as an HTML guidance map for you when you're creating blogposts in a CMS. All the elements you need that have related schema markup are listed in the example. While you probably won't need them all, everything to do need should be in there. When modifying this component you should feel free to use any HTML that fits the structure and hierarchy of your project, while maintaining any of the schema-related HTML attributes (`itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop`, etc.).
