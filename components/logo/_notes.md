Notes
==========

The logo component contains microdata that will produce a [generated logo](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/logo) in Google search results. When modifying this component you should feel free to use any HTML that fits the structure and hierarchy of your project, while maintaining any of the schema-related HTML attributes (`itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop`, etc.).
