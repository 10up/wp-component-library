==========

The off-canvas menu component is meant to be a common, and accessible, starting point for any off canvas navigation menu. This menu is off-canvas fir both large and small screen layouts. The default HTML should work within the confines of WordPress, but some modifications may have to be implemented for your specific use case. No jQuery is required.
