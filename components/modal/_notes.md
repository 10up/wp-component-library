Notes
==========

The modal dialog component is a standard and accessible JavaScript plugin that was converted from a jQuery plugin originally created in a Smashing Magazine article. This component is keyboard accessible, reusable, and properly traps focus while the dialog is open. It also exposes a small API via a callback function you can hook into if you need to extend the functionality. No jQuery is required.

The `modal.hash.click.js` extension ships with this component to auto-trigger modal dialogs when a URL hash is visited. It is option, but recommended.
